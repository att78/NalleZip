Pocket Therapist

Mobile phones have changed the field of mental health self-treatments. Mobile phone user no longer needs therapist to start their own therapy. Mobile phone applications offer versatile possibilities of self-development for the user. User can develop their cognitive abilities, memory, or gain some stress-management tools. User can also treat their depression or anxiety with a mobile phone app.

Mobile software applications are easy-to-approach-tools for many mental issues. They are always available and ready to offer guidance mobile phone owner is seeking. Most of the apps are also very affordable if compared to therapists, psychologists, or mental guides of any sort. Mental health apps can comfort the user also when it is not otherwise possible. Everything sounds fine, but it still raises many questions, like "How efficient, these self-treatment applications are?"

Liza Hoffman, Emily Benedetto, Hsiang Huang, Ellie Grossman, Dorosella Kaluma, Ziva Mann, and John Torous researched the effectiveness of mobile apps meant to help with insomnia, anxiety, and depression. They included several different mobile phone applications to their research to cover a variety of mental health issues. Based on their research Augmenting Mental Health in Primary Care: A 1-Year Study of Deploying Smartphone Apps in a Multi-site Primary Care/Behavioral Health Integration Program, Al, approximately 2/3 of patients using mobile apps considered them useful and helpful. Even though most users found apps useful, there is still a remarkable minority that could not benefit from them. Approximately 20% of patients could not use mobile apps. This was also the major reason they did not benefit from apps. I calculated based on these numbers that lack of ability to use the apps explained about 60% of the cases where apps were not useful.

Another research focused on one software application. The article Guided Self-Help Works explains the test results of the anxiety disorder and depression treatment app Pasifica. The research goal was to find out if Pasifica could help those who must wait for their first appointment. Pasifica offers guided exercises and peer-support. Peer-support is not moderated or controlled by health professionals. It allows app users to share their experiences anonymously. Researches compared Pasifica's users to people who were on the wait list for treatment. Using the app offered significant help for patients who were waiting for their first appointment with their therapist. Researches did not compare Pasifica's users to those patients who had already had therapy sessions.

Often researches of mental health apps have a focus on how the app works as a sidekick. It is obvious, that mental health apps make a valuable contribution that improves the users condition. That is why scientists tend to consider mental apps as great tools. In both cases mentioned above, researchers concluded that apps are surely better than doing nothing. In these researches traditional therapy scheme is still untouched. Therapist still leads and guides therapy and mobile phone user is still patient, who is subject to medical care treatment.

This traditional scheme is now changing. In some cases, mobile phone app is the solution instead of being part of the solution. An app can really take the role of the solo artist and replace a human therapist. Insomnia, for example, is an issue that has also app-based therapy. In the article Efficacy of a Theory-Based Cognitive Behavioral Technique App-Based Intervention for Patients With Insomnia: Randomized Controlled Trial, researchers conclude that stand-alone insomnia treatment with the digital cognitive behavioral technique has positive results. The only human insomnia therapist, the app user needs, is the one looking back from the mirror. Maybe it is also reflecting future of the mental therapy.
